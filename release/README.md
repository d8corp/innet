## Abstract
The main mission is simplifying and standardizing application development.

`innet` includes all the best features of famous libraries and frameworks.
`innet` looks like all you've seen but at the same time it's completely different.
`innet` is an ecosystem for JavaScript, but the same time it's just a function.
This is an out-of-the-box solution, at least, going to be.
`innet` provides you any tools you need to build any JavaScript application:

- [x] API Server
- [x] Web Site
- [ ] Browser Plugin
- [ ] Native Application

### JSX Everywhere
`JSX` provides you the maximum experience of aligning the code.
`innet` includes `JSX` by default.
Check [@innet/jsx](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innet/jsx) to get more.

> **YOU CAN USE `JSX` ON THE SERVER SIDE!**

### Split By Plugins
Include only code you need, whole functional splits by plugins you can connect (disconnect) separately.
From `refs`, `portals`, `context`, `life cycle`, `state management` on frontend side
to `router`, `components`, `proxy`, `async`, `html` on server side and more.

> **YOU CAN USE SAME PLUGINS ON BOTH SIDES!**

### Components
The component approach is a powerful technology, that `innet` supports.
You can reuse a piece of an application, and that's awesome.

> **YOU CAN USE SAME COMPONENTS ON BOTH SIDES!**

There are a lot of features you can see below, welcome!

## Install
npm
```bash
npm i innet
```
yarn
```bash
yarn add innet
```

## Usage
> You can start learning of `innet` from [@innet/dom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innet/dom), for the front-end side,
> or [@innet/server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innet/server) for the back-end.

`innet` is a function which expects 2 required arguments.
The first one is an application and the second one is a handler of the application.
Like you can say **what** to do and **how**.
```typescript
import innet from 'innet'

import app from './app' // what to do
import handler from './handler' // how to do

innet(app, handler)
```

`app` can be `any` type, but `handler` should be a `Handler`.
You can create the handler with `createHandler` function.
```typescript
import { createHandler } from 'innet'

export default createHandler([])
```

By default, the handler does nothing, but you can set any functionality by plugins.

```typescript
const sum = () => ([a, b]) => {
  console.log(a + b)
}
// sum is a plugin

const plugins = [
  sum,
]

const handler = createHandler(plugins)

innet([1, 2], handler)
// 3
```

### Plugins
A plugin is a function which runs during a handler creation and returns `HandlerPlugin`.

For example, here is a logger plugin.

```typescript
import { HandlerPlugin, NEXT, useApp } from 'innet'

function logger(): HandlerPlugin {
  console.log('logger: initialisation')

  return () => {
    console.log('logger: app', useApp())

    return NEXT
  }
}
```

`HandlerPlugin` is a function that can use 2 hooks: `useApp` and `useHandler`.

As another example, let's look at the plugin of `async` which allows promises handling.

```typescript
import innet, { HandlerPlugin, NEXT, useApp, useHandler } from 'innet'

function async(): HandlerPlugin {
  return () => {
    const app = useApp()

    if (!(app instanceof Promise)) return NEXT

    const handler = useHandler()

    app.then(data => innet(data, handler))
  }
}
```

Let's try those plugins
```typescript
const app = new Promise(resolve => resolve('test'))

const handler = createHandler([
  logger,
  async,
])
// > 'logger: initialisation'

innet(app, handler)
// > 'logger: app', Promise

await app
// > 'logger: app', 'test'
```

The order of the plugins is important.

```typescript
const app = new Promise(resolve => resolve('test'))

const handler = createHandler([
  async, // change order
  logger,
])
// > 'logger: initialisation'

innet(app, handler)
// nothing happens

await app
// > 'logger: app', 'test'
```

### Extend a handler
You can extend a handler with `createHandler`,
just provide the previous handler to the second argument.

```typescript
const handler1 = createHandler([
  async,
  sum,
])

const handler2 = createHandler([
  logger,
], handler1)
```

Check out [@innet/utils](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@innet/utils),
there you can find the most general plugins and utils.
